🎄 Interactive Christmas Light Switch (HTML, CSS, JS)

This project demonstrates a dramatic and visually stunning UI interaction using simple front-end code. It features a clickable switch that toggles a central element (the Christmas Tree) from a dark, hidden state to a brightly glowing, stylized state.

✨ Key Features

Dramatic Toggle: A single click/tap animates the physical switch lever.

Aesthetic Reveal: The tree uses multiple CSS box-shadow layers to create an intense, realistic glow on the ornaments and light bulb when the power is turned ON.

Clean CSS State: The entire visual transformation (background color change, switch position, and ornament glow) is controlled by toggling one JavaScript class (.lights-on) on the <body> element.

Cute & Layered Tree: The tree uses layered, rounded CSS shapes instead of a simple cone for a modern, cute aesthetic.
